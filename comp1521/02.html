      <h1>2: Welcome to MIPS<b>!</b></h1>

      <h2>MIPS</h2>

      <p>In this course, we'll be spending the first half programming in a language called MIPS Assembly Language, and then around Week 5 we'll switch back to C to apply what we've learned<b>!</b></p>

      <p>A big theme throughout computer science is the idea that we're always building new abstractions on top of what came before. In that sense, we can refer to programming languages as <q>high-level</q> and <q>low-level</q>, based on how many layers of abstraction there are between the code we write and, like, raw binary machine code.</p>

      <p>C is a low-level language - we're manually allocating and freeing memory<b>!</b> Still, though, there are enough abstractions that for a computer to understand it we have to compile it down to machine code. Compiling unpacks all those layers of abstraction.</p>

      <p>MIPS is a level below C - it's only a half-step above writing raw binary machine code. Every line of MIPS code can actually be find-and-replaced with binary machine code, one-for-one. This conversion from MIPS code to machine code is so trivial it's not even called compilation, it's called <q>assembly</q>. This is what makes MIPS an <q>assembly language</q>.</p>

      <p>Because MIPS is so close to the computer, it's actually tied to specific hardware - MIPS Assembly Language only runs on MIPS CPUs.</p>

      <h2>Mipsy<b>!</b></h2>

      <p>None of us have MIPS CPUs in our laptops, though - we probably all have x86 or ARM processors, which use their own assembly languages, so how are we going to write code in this course if we can't run MIPS on our machines?</p>

      <p>We use an emulator called <q>Mipsy</q>, which simulates a MIPS CPU that can run our code. It also has some extra shortcuts (bonus <q>pseudoinstructions</q>), specific to this course, that help us focus on what we want to teach you and smooth over what we don't care about.</p>

      <p>We also have an online GUI Mipsy-emulator, called <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/mipsy/">mipsy-web</a>, which is very useful for debugging<b>!</b> You'll see me use this in tutorials if I ever make a particularly baffling error.</p>

      <p>You're probably getting the (accurate) impression that coding in MIPS assembly likely won't be very useful for you in the future. In this course, we're only using MIPS as a learning tool to understand those layers of abstraction, to understand what's happening in the computer, behind the scenes when we write code.</p>

      <h2>Variables in MIPS</h2>
      <p>So<b>!</b> Content<b>!</b></p>

      <p>In C, when we create a variable, with something like <code class="language-c">int i = 0;</code>, that variable is stored in memory, probably on the stack.</p>

      <p>Because we're so low-level in MIPS, if we wanted to store a value in memory, we'd have to allocate that space on the stack ourselves, and we'd have to move values back and forth between memory and the CPU every time we wanted to do calculations with them<b>!</b></p>

      <p>I don't really want to do that, if I can avoid it. Instead, we can save effort by storing a lot of our variables directly in the CPU instead.</p>

      <h2>Registers</h2>

      <p>Inside the CPU, there are spaces for us to store 32 values. These spaces are called registers.</p>

      <p>Unlike variables in C, we don't have to declare, name, or allocate memory for values we store in these registers. They are literally little circuits that physically exist inside the CPU, ready and waiting for us to chuck a value in them<b>!</b></p>

      <p>Each register has a name and a convential usage that we expect you to follow in this course. When everybody follows convention, we can rely on other peoples' code to work how we expect.</p>

      <p>Here's a table of registers, arranged by purpose rather than by index. Contrast it to the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#registers">Registers</a> section of our MIPS Documentation page.</p>

      <h2>Q1: Basics</h2>

      <p>Throughout all our MIPS programming in this course, we'll almost never ask you to actually solve problems from scratch using MIPS. Instead, we'll give you a C program, and we'll ask you to write a MIPS equivalent that does <b>exactly</b> the same thing.</p>

      <p>For example, we could be given this file, <code class="language-plaintext">q1.c</code>, and ask you to convert it to mips:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">// Prints the square of a number

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x, y;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    y = x * x;

    printf("%d\n", y);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Spend a moment making sure you actually understand what this code does: we read in a number, square it, and print it back out.</p>

      <p>Let's create a MIPS file, <code class="language-plaintext">q1.s</code> (.s for s-emmbly<b>!</b>) My usual approach for converting C code to MIPS is to start with the easiest line first, which in this case, is the comment:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact"># Prints the square of a number</code></pre>

      <p>As you can see, that comments in MIPS are done with a <code class="language-python">#</code> rather than a <code class="language-c">//</code>.</p>

      <p>Okay, next up, I'll do the bare basics of setting up our main function. I'll create something called a <q>label</q>, which is a bit like a function. It basically lets us say <q>This part of our code is called <code class="language-mipsasm">main:</code>.</q></p>

      <p>I've also written <code class="language-mipsasm">jr $ra</code>, which is equivalent to a <code class="language-c">return;</code> in C. More on that in Week 4 when we learn about functions, for now just consider it boilerplate to put at the bottom of your main function.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">main:

	jr	$ra	# return</code></pre>

      <p>Let's start converting things over to MIPS line-by-line, starting with those variable declarations for <code class="language-plaintext">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext">y</code>.</p>

      <p>In C, those lines will allocate space for these variables on the stack, but we probably want to use registers instead. Since we don't need to name or allocate registers, there's nothing mechanically to do here, so we'll just decide which registers to use, and leave a comment to remind us:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	# x in $t0
	# y in $t1</code></pre>

      <p>Alright, let's move onto the first print statement. In C, <code class="language-plaintext">printf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext">scanf</code> come from the <code class="language-plaintext">stdio.h</code> library, which lets us handle inputs and outputs, no matter what operating system we're using. In MIPS, we don't really have access to such a high-level library like this, so we have to ask the operating system directly to perform tasks, with an <b>instruction</b> called <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>.</p>

      <p>Now, <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> can perform a lot of different tasks: printing things, scanning things, even reading files. Let's refer to the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#syscalls">System Services</a> section of the MIPS Documentation page. Looking at the left-most column, we can see that the way that the CPU knows which <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> to perform is by checking the value in the <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code> register.</p>

      <p>So, to print a string, for example, we want to make sure that <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code> has a register of <code class="language-mipsasm">4</code> before we <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>, and that <code class="language-mipsasm">$a0</code> has a pointer to our string.</p>

      <p>But how do we get a pointer to our string? In our C code we use something called a <q>string literal</q>, which will get replaced by a pointer to the data section of memory when we compile our code. In MIPS, we'll have to load the string into memory ourselves.</p>

      <p>We'll add some lines at the bottom of our file to direct the MIPS assembler to load our string into memory, like so:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	.data
prompt_str:
	.asciiz "Enter a number: "</code></pre>

      <p>Here, <code class="language-mipsasm">.data</code> is a <q>directive</q>, which tells the assembler: <q>The following lines describe what to put into the data section of memory.</q></p>

      <p>We have another directive here, <code class="language-mipsasm">.asciiz</code>, which tells the assembler to load that string into memory when we run our program.</p>

      <p>Finally, we use a label, <code class="language-mipsasm">prompt_str:</code>, to act as a pointer to the string. It basically lets us say <q>This part of memory is called <code class="language-mipsasm">prompt_str:</code>.</q></p>

      <p>We're now finally ready to write our print statement <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> into our <code class="language-mipsasm">main:</code> function:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	la	$a0, prompt_str	# printf("Enter a number: ")
	li	$v0, 4		# mode 4: print_str
	syscall</code></pre>

      <p>The <code class="language-mipsasm">la</code> instruction loads the memory address of a label into a register, and the <code class="language-mipsasm">li</code> instruction loads an <q>immediate</q> - a value known at compile time - into a register. Note the order of the arguments: destination first. You can think of <code class="language-mipsasm">li $t0, 4</code> as a bit like <code class="language-c">t0 = 4;</code>.</p>

      <p>We can write a few more <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>s, in the same way:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	li	$v0, 5		# scanf("%d", &x)
	syscall			# mode 5: read_int
	move	$t0, $v0
	
	# TODO: y = x * x

	move	$a0, $t1	# printf("%d", y)
	li	$v0, 1		# mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'	# printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11		# mode 11: print_char
	syscall</code></pre>
        
      <p>For our <code class="language-plaintext">read_int</code>, note that the integer we scanned in will be put into <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code>, so we'll use the <code class="language-mipsasm">move</code> instruction to copy it to <code class="language-mipsasm">$t0</code>, as we want to scan into <code class="language-plaintext">x</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Also note that our <code class="language-c">printf("%d\n", y);</code> was split across two <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>s: a <code class="language-plaintext">print_int</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext">print_char</code>.</p>

      <p>All that's left is our <code class="language-c">y = x * x;</code>. To find an instruction for this, we'll scroll through the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#insn-arith">Arithmetic Instructions</a> section of the MIPS Documentation, scanning the <q>Description</q> column for something that looks right. The <code class="language-mipsasm">mul</code> instruction looks good<b>!</b> We'll use it to write our final line of code for this question, leaving us with:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm"># Prints the square of a number

main:
	# x in $t0
	# y in $t1

	la	$a0, prompt_str	# printf("Enter a number: ")
	li	$v0, 4		# mode 4: print_str
	syscall

	li	$v0, 5		# scanf("%d", &x)
	syscall			# mode 5: read_int
	move	$t0, $v0
	
	mul	$t1, $t0, $t0	# y = x * x;

	move	$a0, $t1	# printf("%d", y)
	li	$v0, 1		# mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'	# printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11		# mode 11: print_char
	syscall

	jr	$ra		# return

	.data
prompt_str:
	.asciiz "Enter a number: "</code></pre>

      <p>Note that the comments are all aligned on the right. That way, we don't have to puzzle out what each line of assembly means - we can just read the C code in the comments instead<b>!</b></p>

      <p>Now we can run it on a CSE machine (or in TigerVNC or an SSH terminal) like so:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-shell">$ 1521 mipsy q1.s
Enter a number: 42
1764</code></pre>

      <h2>Logic & Flow in MIPS</h2>

      <p>Something that we definitely want to figure out how to do in MIPS is <q>control flow</q> - a way to tell the CPU to take different paths through our code instead of just executing it top-to-bottom. We want to learn how to do if statements and loops.</p>

      <p>In C, there's this idea of nesting - you can put code inside curly brackets to create a <q>code block</q>, and then execute different code blocks in different circumstances. MIPS doesn't have this concept.</p>
      
      <p>In MIPS, the closest equivalent we have to code blocks is labels, like we used for <code class="language-mipsasm">main:</code> and <code class="language-mipsasm">prompt_str:</code>. The only tools we have for control flow in MIPS are <q>branch instructions</q>, which tell the CPU to jump to a label, and start executing code from that point onwards.</p>
      
      <p>C actually has some features similar to these<b>!</b> You can write labels into your C code, same as MIPS, and you can use statements called <code class="language-c">goto</code>s as an equivalent for MIPS branch instructions. For this reason, people often like to first convert their C code to <q>Simple C</q>, using labels and <code class="language-c">goto</code>s, before converting their Simple C to MIPS.</p>

      <h2>Q2: <code class="language-c">goto</code>s & If Statements</h2>

      <p>Let's say we've been asked to translate the C program below, <code class="language-plaintext">q2.c</code> into MIPS. This is pretty similar to Q1, but with an if-statement, so we won't need to make too many changes to our MIPS code.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">// Squares a number, unless its square is too big for a 32-bit integer.
// If it is too big, prints an error message instead.

#include <stdio.h>

#define SQUARE_MAX 46340

int main(void) {
    int x, y;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    if (x > SQUARE_MAX) {
        printf("square too big for 32 bits\n");
    } else {
        y = x * x;
        printf("%d\n", y);
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Let's start by converting it to simple C, using labels and <code class="language-c">goto</code>s rather than an if-else statement. Here's <code class="language-plaintext">q2.simple.c</code>:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">// Squares a number, unless its square is too big for a 32-bit integer.
// If it is too big, prints an error message instead.

#include <stdio.h>

#define SQUARE_MAX 46340

int main(void) {
    int x, y;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    
    if (x <= SQUARE_MAX) goto x_is_ok;
x_is_too_big:
        printf("square too big for 32 bits\n");
        goto end_if;
x_is_ok:
        y = x * x;
        printf("%d\n", y);
end_if:

    return 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>I want you to note 3 things here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of our condition telling us whether to <b>execute</b> the <q>true</q> branch, it must now tell us whether to <b>skip</b> it, as our only tool is <code class="language-c">goto</code>s, so it's been inverted from <code class="language-c">x > SQUARE_MAX:</code> to <code class="language-c">x <= SQUARE_MAX</code>.</li>
        <li>Under the <code class="language-c">x_is_too_big:</code> label, we have a <code class="language-c">goto end_if;</code> Think about what would happen if we didn't have this: the CPU would just continue going line-by-line, and would execute <b>both</b> branches of the if statement<b>!</b></li>
        <li>Our label names are descriptive, and we have more than we need. <code class="language-c">x_is_too_big:</code> is not actually used by our code, but it's descriptive and helps us understand what's going on.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now that we've converted our original C code to Simple C, it's easy enough to convert it over to MIPS:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm"># Squares a number, unless its square is too big for a 32-bit integer.
# If it is too big, prints an error message instead.

SQUARE_MAX = 46340

main:
	# x in $t0
	# y in $t1

	la	$a0, prompt_str			# printf("Enter a number: ")
	li	$v0, 4				# mode 4: print_str
	syscall

	li	$v0, 5				# scanf("%d", &x)
	syscall					# mode 5: read_int
	move	$t0, $v0
	
	ble	$t0, SQUARE_MAX, x_is_ok	# if (x <= SQUARE_MAX) goto x_is_ok

x_is_too_big:
	la	$a0, error_str			# printf("square too big for 32 bits\n")
	li	$v0, 4				# mode 4: print_str
	syscall

	b	end_if				# goto end_if

x_is_ok:
	mul	$t1, $t0, $t0			# y = x * x

	move	$a0, $t1			# printf("%d", y)
	li	$v0, 1				# mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'			# printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11				# mode 11: print_char
	syscall

end_if:
	jr	$ra				# return

	.data
prompt_str:
	.asciiz "Enter a number: "
error_str:
	.asciiz "square too big for 32 bits\n"</code></pre>

      <p>We can use the same labels as our simple C code, and replace the <code class="language-c">goto</code>s with branch instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <code class="language-c">goto</code> with no condition gets replaced with <q>Unconditional Branch</q>: <code class="language-mipsasm">b</code>.</li>
        <li>The <code class="language-c">goto</code> with the if condition gets replaced with <q>Branch on Less Than or Equal</q>: <code class="language-mipsasm">ble</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There's a whole family of different branch instructions with different conditions. Check out the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#insn-brjmp">Branch and Jump Instructions</a> section of the MIPS documentation to check out the rest.</p>

      <h2>Q3: Combining Conditions</h2>

      Although there are many branch instructions in MIPS, there are still only a limited number of options. When you encounter a C program with a more complex condition, like the one below, you'll have to figure out how to recreate it using only the branch instructions available to you.

      <pre><code class="language-c">#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    if (x > 100 && x < 1000) {
        printf("medium\n");
    } else {
        printf("small/big\n");
    }

    return;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Because this is an <q>and</q> condition, the statement will only be true if both halves are true. So if either half is false, we want to jump to the else block.</p>

      <p>We can simplify this like so:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    if (x <= 100) goto x_is_small_or_big;
    if (x >= 1000) goto x_is_small_or_big;

x_is_medium:
    printf("medium\n");
    goto end_if;

x_is_small_or_big:
    printf("small/big\n");

end_if:
    return;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Make sure you understand why this works before moving on. Think through what this code would do in a couple of scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Q4: Loops!</h2>

      <p>Let's move onto loops<b>!</b> The program below uses a <q>for loop</q>, which is a lot like a while loop but compacted into one line - this makes it easier to avoid infinite loops, because you'll never forget the <code class="language-c">i++;</code>.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">// Print every third number from 24 to 42.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    // This 'for' loop is effectively equivalent to a while loop.
    // i.e. it is a while loop with a counter built in.
    for (int x = 24; x < 42; x += 3) {
        printf("%d\n", x);
    }

}</code></pre>

      <p>We can create a loop in MIPS by having an unconditional branch at the end of the loop that jumps back up to the top, and a condition branch at the top of the loop that makes sure we exit the loop when the loop's condition stops being true.</p>

      <p>But, like a while loop in C, it's easy to forget things this way, and a broken loop in MIPS is much harder to debug than one in C, so I recommend using 5 labels, rather than the bare minimum 2:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm">loop_init: # initialise our loop variable
loop_cond: # check whether we need to exit the loop
loop_body: # the contents of the loop
loop_incr: # increment our loop variable, and jump back to the condition
loop_end:  # the label we jump to to exit our loop</code></pre>

      <p>Accordingly, here's what our MIPS code looks like<b>!</b> I would advise to use more descriptive label names than this, </p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm"># Print every third number from 24 to 42.

main:
	# x in $t0

loop_init:
	li	$t0, 24			# int x = 24

loop_cond:
	bge	$t0, 42, loop_end	# while x < 42 {

loop_body:
	move	$a0, $t0		#     printf("%d", x)
	li	$v0, 1			#     mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'		#     printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11			#     mode 11: print_char
	syscall

loop_step:
	add	$t0, $t0, 3		#     x += 3
	b	loop_cond		# }

loop_end:
	jr	$ra			# return</code></pre>
