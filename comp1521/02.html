      <h1>2: Welcome to MIPS<b>!</b></h1>

      <h2>MIPS</h2>

      <p>In this course, we'll be spending the first half programming in a language called MIPS Assembly Language, and then around Week 5 we'll switch back to C to apply what we've learned<b>!</b></p>

      <p>A big theme throughout computer science is the idea that we're always building new abstractions on top of what came before. In that sense, we can refer to programming languages as <q>high-level</q> and <q>low-level</q>, based on how many layers of abstraction there are between the code we write and, like, raw binary machine code.</p>

      <p>C is a low-level language - we're manually allocating and freeing memory<b>!</b> Still, though, there are enough abstractions that for a computer to understand it we have to compile it down to machine code. Compiling unpacks all those layers of abstraction.</p>

      <p>MIPS is a level below C - it's only a half-step above writing raw binary machine code. Every line of MIPS code can actually be find-and-replaced with binary machine code, one-for-one. This conversion from MIPS code to machine code is so trivial it's not even called compilation, it's called <q>assembly</q>. This is what makes MIPS an <q>assembly language</q>.</p>

      <p>Because MIPS is so close to the computer, it's actually tied to specific hardware - MIPS Assembly Language only runs on MIPS CPUs.</p>

      <h2>Mipsy<b>!</b></h2>

      <p>None of us have MIPS CPUs in our laptops, though - we probably all have x86 or ARM processors, which use their own assembly languages, so how are we going to write code in this course if we can't run MIPS on our machines?</p>

      <p>We use an emulator called <q>Mipsy</q>, which simulates a MIPS CPU that can run our code. It also has some extra shortcuts (bonus <q>pseudoinstructions</q>), specific to this course, that help us focus on what we want to teach you and smooth over what we don't care about.</p>

      <p>We also have an online GUI Mipsy-emulator, called <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/mipsy/">mipsy-web</a>, which is very useful for debugging<b>!</b> You'll see me use this in tutorials if I ever make a particularly baffling error.</p>

      <p>You're probably getting the (accurate) impression that coding in MIPS assembly likely won't be very useful for you in the future. In this course, we're only using MIPS as a learning tool to understand those layers of abstraction, to understand what's happening in the computer, behind the scenes when we write code.</p>

      <h2>Variables in MIPS</h2>
      <p>So<b>!</b> Content<b>!</b></p>

      <p>In C, when we create a variable, with something like <code class="language-c">int i = 0;</code>, that variable is stored in memory, probably on the stack.</p>

      <p>Because we're so low-level in MIPS, if we wanted to store a value in memory, we'd have to allocate that space on the stack ourselves, and we'd have to move values back and forth between memory and the CPU every time we wanted to do calculations with them<b>!</b></p>

      <p>I don't really want to do that, if I can avoid it. Instead, we can save effort by storing a lot of our variables directly in the CPU instead.</p>

      <h2>Registers</h2>

      <p>Inside the CPU, there are spaces for us to store 32 values. These spaces are called registers.</p>

      <p>Unlike variables in C, we don't have to declare, name, or allocate memory for values we store in these registers. They are literally little circuits that physically exist inside the CPU, ready and waiting for us to chuck a value in them<b>!</b></p>

      <p>Each register has a name and a convential usage that we expect you to follow in this course. When everybody follows convention, we can rely on other peoples' code to work how we expect.</p>

      <p>Here's a table of registers, arranged by purpose rather than by index. Contrast it to the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#registers">Registers</a> section of our MIPS Documentation page.</p>

      <h2>Q1: Basics</h2>

      <p>Throughout all our MIPS programming in this course, we'll almost never ask you to actually solve problems from scratch using MIPS. Instead, we'll give you a C program, and we'll ask you to write a MIPS equivalent that does <b>exactly</b> the same thing.</p>

      <p>For example, we could be given this file, <code class="language-plaintext">q1.c</code>, and ask you to convert it to mips:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">// Prints the square of a number

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int x, y;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    y = x * x;

    printf("%d\n", y);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Spend a moment making sure you actually understand what this code does: we read in a number, square it, and print it back out.</p>

      <p>Let's create a MIPS file, <code class="language-plaintext">q1.s</code> (.s for s-emmbly<b>!</b>) My usual approach for converting C code to MIPS is to start with the easiest line first, which in this case, is the comment:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact"># Prints the square of a number</code></pre>

      <p>As you can see, that comments in MIPS are done with a <code class="language-python">#</code> rather than a <code class="language-c">//</code>.</p>

      <p>Okay, next up, I'll do the bare basics of setting up our main function. I'll create something called a <q>label</q>, which is a bit like a function. It basically lets us say <q>This part of our code is called <code class="language-mipsasm">main:</code>.</q></p>

      <p>I've also written <code class="language-mipsasm">jr $ra</code>, which is equivalent to a <code class="language-c">return;</code> in C. More on that in Week 4 when we learn about functions, for now just consider it boilerplate to put at the bottom of your main function.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">main:

	jr	$ra	# return</code></pre>

      <p>Let's start converting things over to MIPS line-by-line, starting with those variable declarations for <code class="language-plaintext">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext">y</code>.</p>

      <p>In C, those lines will allocate space for these variables on the stack, but we probably want to use registers instead. Since we don't need to name or allocate registers, there's nothing mechanically to do here, so we'll just decide which registers to use, and leave a comment to remind us:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	# x in $t0
	# y in $t1</code></pre>

      <p>Alright, let's move onto the first print statement. In C, <code class="language-plaintext">printf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext">scanf</code> come from the <code class="language-plaintext">stdio.h</code> library, which lets us handle inputs and outputs, no matter what operating system we're using. In MIPS, we don't really have access to such a high-level library like this, so we have to ask the operating system directly to perform tasks, with an <b>instruction</b> called <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>.</p>

      <p>Now, <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> can perform a lot of different tasks: printing things, scanning things, even reading files. Let's refer to the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#syscalls">System Services</a> section of the MIPS Documentation page. Looking at the left-most column, we can see that the way that the CPU knows which <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> to perform is by checking the value in the <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code> register.</p>

      <p>So, to print a string, for example, we want to make sure that <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code> has a register of <code class="language-mipsasm">4</code> before we <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>, and that <code class="language-mipsasm">$a0</code> has a pointer to our string.</p>

      <p>But how do we get a pointer to our string? In our C code we use something called a <q>string literal</q>, which will get replaced by a pointer to the data section of memory when we compile our code. In MIPS, we'll have to load the string into memory ourselves.</p>

      <p>We'll add some lines at the bottom of our file to direct the MIPS assembler to load our string into memory, like so:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	.data
prompt_str:
	.asciiz "Enter a number: "</code></pre>

      <p>Here, <code class="language-mipsasm">.data</code> is a <q>directive</q>, which tells the assembler: <q>The following lines describe what to put into the data section of memory.</q></p>

      <p>We have another directive here, <code class="language-mipsasm">.asciiz</code>, which tells the assembler to load that string into memory when we run our program.</p>

      <p>Finally, we use a label, <code class="language-mipsasm">prompt_str:</code>, to act as a pointer to the string. It basically lets us say <q>This part of memory is called <code class="language-mipsasm">prompt_str:</code>.</q></p>

      <p>We're now finally ready to write our print statement <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code> into our <code class="language-mipsasm">main:</code> function:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	la	$a0, prompt_str	# printf("Enter a number: ")
	li	$v0, 4		# mode 4: print_str
	syscall</code></pre>

      <p>The <code class="language-mipsasm">la</code> instruction loads the memory address of a label into a register, and the <code class="language-mipsasm">li</code> instruction loads an <q>immediate</q> - a value known at compile time - into a register. Note the order of the arguments: destination first. You can think of <code class="language-mipsasm">li $t0, 4</code> as a bit like <code class="language-c">t0 = 4;</code>.</p>

      <p>We can write a few more <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>s, in the same way:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm compact">	li	$v0, 5		# scanf("%d", &x)
	syscall			# mode 5: read_int
	move	$t0, $v0
	
	# TODO: y = x * x

	move	$a0, $t1	# printf("%d", y)
	li	$v0, 1		# mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'	# printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11		# mode 11: print_char
	syscall</code></pre>
        
      <p>For our <code class="language-plaintext">read_int</code>, note that the integer we scanned in will be put into <code class="language-mipsasm">$v0</code>, so we'll use the <code class="language-mipsasm">move</code> instruction to copy it to <code class="language-mipsasm">$t0</code>, as we want to scan into <code class="language-plaintext">x</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Also note that our <code class="language-c">printf("%d\n", y);</code> was split across two <code class="language-mipsasm">syscall</code>s: a <code class="language-plaintext">print_int</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext">print_char</code>.</p>

      <p>All that's left is our <code class="language-c">y = x * x;</code>. To find an instruction for this, we'll scroll through the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/current/resources/mips-guide.html#insn-arith">Arithmetic Instructions</a> section of the MIPS Documentation, scanning the <q>Description</q> column for something that looks right. The <code class="language-mipsasm">mul</code> instruction looks good<b>!</b> We'll use it to write our final line of code for this question, leaving us with:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-mipsasm"># Prints the square of a number

main:
	# x in $t0
	# y in $t1

	la	$a0, prompt_str	# printf("Enter a number: ")
	li	$v0, 4		# mode 4: print_str
	syscall

	li	$v0, 5		# scanf("%d", &x)
	syscall			# mode 5: read_int
	move	$t0, $v0
	
	mul	$t1, $t0, $t0	# y = x * x;

	move	$a0, $t1	# printf("%d", y)
	li	$v0, 1		# mode 1: print_int
	syscall

	li	$a0, '\n'	# printf("\n")
	li	$v0, 11		# mode 11: print_char
	syscall

	jr	$ra		# return

	.data
prompt_str:
	.asciiz "Enter a number: "</code></pre>

      <p>Now we can run it on a CSE machine (or in TigerVNC or an SSH terminal) like so:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-shell">$ 1521 mipsy q1.s
Enter a number: 42
1764</code></pre>

      <hr>

      <p>The rest of the page is still WIP!</p>
