      <h1>What I Did in January</h1>

      <p>At the start of 2025, I set up a <b>Bingo Board</b> filled with goals, things I wanted to complete throughout the year. My thought process was that if I had a big menu of things to choose from, I could avoid days spent doing nothing but scrolling.</p>

      <p>It worked okay, but I found my interests drifting throughout the year, and the board didn't allow for picking up new, unforseen projects! I also think it worked out to be more of a litmus test for my burnout rather than a preventative measure.</p>

      <p><b>This year, I'm trying out something different!</b> I've been really enjoying finishing projects, so to motivate that, I'm planning to do a writeup at the end of each month of all the cool things I did, the catch being that only completed projects are allowed to appear. Hopefully I'll aim for smaller-scope projects and actually finish them!</p>

      <p class="sitelen-pona">
        ken la mi pali e ijo pi toki pona<br>

      </p>

      <p>So, here's what I did this month!</p>

      <h2>Ricing sugar-glider</h2>
      <p>I set up my new laptop.</p>

      <h2>ghosted.</h2>
      <p>I worked on a short film.</p>

      <h2>Hadestown Karaoke</h2>
      <p>Oh yeah baby.</p>

      <h2>Birthday Adventure Game</h2>
      <p>My legs hurt so much after.</p>

      <h2 class="sitelen-pona">lipu ma</h2>
      <p class="sitelen-pona">lipu mi li kepeken nasin nasa taso ona li pona lili kin tawa mi</p>
