      <h1>Bronwyn & Skye</h1>

      <p>A character sheet for my Wanderhome character.</p>

      <h2>Bronwyn (she/they)</h2>

      <p><b>Playbook:</b> The Firelight.</p>

      <p><b>Animal:</b> Raccoon.</p>

      <p><b>2 I try to be:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Endlessly Patient.</li>
        <li>A Good Judge Of Character.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>2 I know I can't be:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always Positive.</li>
        <li>Everywhere At Once.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>My look:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mud-Soaked Cloak.</li>
        <li>Wide-Brimmed Hat That Covers My Eyes.</li>
        <li>Deck Of Playing Cards.</li>
        <li>Book Of Small Rituals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>The light I still keep lit:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A rusted iron lantern that my mother carried before me.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>The light that died out long ago  :</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Wisp, a small and forgotten <b>many-faced</b> god who was in love with my firefly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>What did I show Erin that she didn't want to see?</b>
        <br>
        That her faith was at times beholden to convenience.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Why does my firefly like Elannia so much?</b>
        <br>
        Because there's hope in her yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How did I save Erin when her inexperience tripped her up?</b>
        <br>
        I taught her that she should keep her fallen star out of sunlight, so it doesn't fade.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What does Elannia say that I've gotten so tired of?</b>
        <br>
        <q>But why?</q>
      </p>

      <b>Some things I can always do:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Shrug.</li>
        <li>Pet my firefly.</li>
        <li>Illuminate all that is hard to see.</li>
        <li>Keep walking.</li>
        <li>Say: <q><b>Watch your step.</b></q></li>
        <li>Ask: <q><b>Do you need a hand?</b></q> They get a token if they accept my help.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>During each seasonal holiday, choose 1 I haven't chosen before:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Teach my firefly something new she can always do.</li>
        <li>Teach my firefly something else new she can always do.</li>
        <li>Learn from my firefly an important life lesson, and get a new thing I can always do
        from any playbook.</li>
        <li>Realize I don't have to be something I always forced myself to be.</li>
        <li>Get a token whenever I put your trust in someone else's hands.</li>
        <li>Spend a token to know how to get where I'm trying to go, no matter how far away.</li>
        <li>I can always ask: <q><b>Can you lead the way?</b></q></li>
        <li>Take an unused playbook and add as much as I want from that playbook to mine.</li>
        <li>I met someone new who needs my guidance more than my friends do, and I
        need to part ways. Pick up a new playbook and make a new character.</li>
      </ul>
