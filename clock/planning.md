solstice is dec 21.5 (midnight)
magic noon on nov 3
magic noon on feb 8

48.5 days difference


with this equation I get 48.93 which is like pretty good, and those close days are close
365.2425/4 * cos(x*PI/2*23.439)



okay so the disappearing twilight
if it's within that range, I want to look at the hour angle and then interpolate

so like say, nadir is -9, which is halfway between -6 and -12

say it gets to 0 at 1 hour before nadir, and nadir is -9, then we say it gets to -6 20 mins before nadir

or maybe the strat is find out what time it reached the limit, like compare it to where it would disappear from and interp between that nadir, who knows

though lowkey maybe it's fine who knows
